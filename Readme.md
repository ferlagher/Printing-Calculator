## Basic calculations

Before starting any calculation, press [CA] to make sure memory is reset.

**Important:** This calculator operates like and adding machine. This means that some operations like addition and subtraction works different than a regular calculator.

### Addition and subtraction

Digit the number followed by its sign [⩲] [-] to add it to the memory.
Then press the total key [\*] to print the result and add it to the grand total memory.  
You can print the grand total using the key [G\*].  
To print the actual subtotal during a sum, use [♢/#].

Ex.:  
[2][0][⩲] => 20.00 +  
[5][.][5][-] => 5.50 -  
[♢/#] => 14.50 ♢  
[1][0][⩲] => 10.00 +  
[\*] => 24.50 \*  

[6][5][.][5][-] => 65.5 -  
[1][5][⩲] => 15.00 +  
[\*] => -50.50 \*  

[G\*] => -26.00 \*  

### Multiplication and division

Digit the number followed by the multiplication [×] or division [÷] key, then digit the next number and press [⩲] to add it or [-] to subtract it to the total.  
You can also multiply or divide the previous total.  

Ex.:   
[9][×] => 9.00 ×  
[2][⩲] => 2.00 = 18.00 +  

[9][×] => 9.00 ×  
[2][-] => 2.00 = 18.00 -  

[\*] => 0.00 \*  

Ex.:  
[1][00][⩲] => 100.00 +  
[2][00][⩲] => 200.00 +  
[÷] => 300.00 ÷  
[3][⩲] => 3.00 = 100.00 +  

## Memory

To use the independent memory, press [M+] or [M-] instead of [⩲] or [-] after a multiplication or division to add the result to the memory.
Use [M♢] to print the current subtotal and [M\*] to print the total and clear the memory.

Ex.:  
[2][×] => 2.00 ×  
[3][M+] => 3.00 = 6.00 M+  

[1][0][÷] => 10.00 ÷  
[2][M-] => 2.00 = 5.00 M-  

[M\*] => 1.00 M\*  

## Percentage

To find the percentage of a number, digit that number followed by the multiplication key [×], then digit the percentage value and press the percent key [%].
You can then add or subtract the result to the inital number pressing [⩲] or [-].

Ex.:   
[5][00][×] => 500.00 ×  
[2][0][%] => 20.00 % = 100.00 ·   
[⩲] => 600 +%  

Ex.:  
[5][00][×] => 500.00 ×  
[2][0][%] => 20.00 % = 100.00 ·   
[-] => 400 -%  

To find what percent of a number is another number, use the division key [÷] instead.

Ex.:  
[1][2][÷] => 12.00 ÷  
[6][0][%] => 60.00 % = 20.00 ·  

## Mark up

To mark up a price, digit the price followed by the multiplication key [×], then digit the profit percentage and press [MD/MU].

Ex.:  
[1][00][×] => 100.00 ×  
[2][0][MD/MU] => 20.00 %M 25.00 · 125.00 ·  

## Tax calculations

To add or subtract taxes to a price, digit the price followed by [TAX+] or [TAX-] respectively.

Ex.:   
[5][0][TAX+] => 50.00 -T 22.00 %T 11.00 T 61.00 +T  

Ex.:  
[6][1][TAX-] => 61.00 +T 22.00 %T 11.00 T 50.00 -T  

## Cost, sell and margin

### Calulating the cost

Digit the sell price followed by the sell key [SELL], then digit the margin rate followed by the margin key [MAR].
Press [MAR] again to print the margin amount or [COST] to print the cost.

Ex.:   
[2][00][SELL] => 200.00 \*\*  
[2][0][MAR] => 20.00 %M 160 ♢♢  
[MAR] => 20.00 %M 40.00 MT  
[COST] => 160.00 ♢♢  

### Calulating the sell price

Digit the cost followed by the cost key [COST], then digit the margin rate followed by the margin key [MAR].
Press [MAR] again to print the margin amount or [SELL] to print the sell price.

Ex.:   
[1][6][0][COST] => 160 ♢♢  
[2][0][MAR] => 20.00 %M 200.00 \*\*  
[MAR] => 20.00 %M 40.00 MT  
[SELL] => 200.00 \*\*  

### Calulating the margin rate and amount

Digit the cost followed by the cost key [COST], then digit the sell price followed by the sell key [SELL] (order doesn't matter). Press [MAR] to print the margin amount.

Ex.:  
[1][6][0][COST] => 160.00 ♢♢  
[2][00][SELL] => 200.00 \*\* 20.00 %M  
[MAR] => 40.00 MT  

## Average

After an addition/subtraction, press the item key [IT] to pritn the average off all items in the sum.

Ex.:  
[1][5][0][⩲] => 150.00 +  
[2][2][0][⩲] => 220.00 +  
[1][00][-] => 100.00 -  
[IT] => 90.00 #
